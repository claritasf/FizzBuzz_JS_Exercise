This is a simple JavaScript excercise, using a for loop and if/else nested conditionals, this excercise can be found in Level 7.3 of JS course of CodeCademy.

The game is called FizzBuzz. The rules are simple. I create a viriable to count from 1 to 20. But if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". And if the number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz".

If the number is divisible by 3 AND 5 will print "FizzBuzz"!
